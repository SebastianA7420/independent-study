# <center>Week One Entry</center> 
### <center>This week was used for figuring out what topic I was going to move forward with.</center> 
## Monday:
I was given an overview of the independent study unit in class. We were told that we would have more freedom to create whatever we wanted **(as long as it was tech related, of course)**. Moving forward, I had to find a topic that interested me and use it to learn and create something. I have nine weeks to do this. At the end of class, a list of possible topics were given.
## Thursday:
I felt very determined to make a phone app. I thought it would be very cool to create something then have it on the app store and a phone. I instantly went to google and researched how to approach such a project. I came across the following link: [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/)<br>
This link introduced me to the necessary elements of making an app for IOS devices. It seemed overwhelming because I needed to code the app using [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/#fast) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). These languages were foreign to me. It was a lot for me to do on my own in nine weeks. It was also recommended to own a Macbook to create the app in these languages. I left class knowing the difficulty of doing all this on my own.
## Friday:
I decided that I was still going to create an app but it was going to be for android instead of IOS. It seemed more easy for me to do in the nine weeks. Again, I went online and researched how I was going to persue this. I came across [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), which was a language for writing apps in andriod and ios. It seemed more simple then what I came across Thursday. Then after speaking with my teacher, I was introduced to [App Inventor](http://www.appinventor.org/). App Inventor was also a service to create apps, and it was much simpler to use because it was block based coding, similar to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). 
## <center>Takeaways/Summary:</center>
I am still determined to make an app. Although I'm unsure what the app will be about, I will know exactly what it will be when I have a steady foundation of how I am going to go about doing this project. By the end of next week I will know what direction I will be going in. It is very difficult for me to commit to something. A takeaway this week was finding out other ways to do something when it is difficult.
