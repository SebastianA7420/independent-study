# <center>Week Five Entry</center>
### <center>This week I continued to code my app through Javascript. I used JQuery to be more efficient in the functionalities. I experimented with different methods to see which I was using to use.</center>
## Monday:
I think that the best way to have a functional app without the hassle of having to code from scratch is to use JQuery. JQuery is going to be very useful to me because I know that it has different methods that I can use for my app. I need to find a GET/POST type of method that will allow me to get the users input and give them back a result. I also would like to have an animation type of method in my app for the actual Magic 8 Ball. Overall JQuery will relieve my Javascript issues heavily because trying to code this from scratch sounds overwhelming.

There's nothing wrong with using JQuery because JQuery is still Javascript...
## Tuesday:
I needed to set up JQuery on my project and it was very easy. I've done JQuery before in SEP, so I went back to some old slides and followed the instructions on how to set it up. Apparently it was only adding one extra line of code into your js file. Then when that was done I could finally start looking online for some methods in Jquery.

## Wednesday:
I have a vision for my app that an actual 8 Ball will be on the screen and give you the advice. I know that to do this I'm going to need some sort of animation. So I do a Google search for **JQuery Methods** and the first link is to w3schools. When I opened the link and I noticed **Animation** right way and I knew that was what I needed. JQuery has a variety of ways for me to have the 8 Ball move. I tinkered around with the code and I know how I'm going to manipulate this for my apps use.

## Thursday:
Today I will find some sort of GET/POST functionality for my app. I went back to w3schools and sure enough I found JQuery Get/Post Method. The examples on w3schools however are a little more difficult to manipulate for my own use because I want the user to put in a question and it returns to them a piece of advice. I need to figure out hown to involve variables and strings into this.

## Takeaways/Summary:
Some takeaways I had this week was to use all your resources and to not be afraid to tinker around with different methods. This week I was able to collect the necessary working pieces for my app and next week will just focus on using these methods for my own app.
