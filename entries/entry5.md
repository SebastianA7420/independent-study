# <center>Week Five Entry</center>
### <center>This week I continued to code my app through Javascript. I used JQuery to be more efficient in the functionalities. I experimented with different methods to see which I was using to use.</center>
## Monday:
I think that the best way to have a functional app without the hassle of having to code from scratch is to use JQuery. JQuery is going to be very useful to me because I know that it has different methods that I can use for my app. I need to find a GET/POST type of method that will allow me to get the users input and give them back a result. I also would like to have an animation type of method in my app for the actual Magic 8 Ball. Overall JQuery will relieve my Javascript issues heavily because trying to code this from scratch sounds overwhelming.

There's nothing wrong with using JQuery because JQuery is still Javascript...
## Tuesday:
I needed to set up JQuery on my project and it was very easy. I've done JQuery before in SEP, so I went back to some old slides and followed the instructions on how to set it up. Apparently it was only adding one extra line of code into your js file. Then when that was done I could finally start looking online for some methods in Jquery.
