# <center>Week Five Entry</center>
### <center>This week I continued to code my app through Javascript. I used JQuery to be more efficient in the functionalities. I experimented with different methods to see which I was using to use.</center>
## Monday:
I think that the best way to have a functional app without the hassle of having to code from scratch is to use JQuery. JQuery is going to be very useful to me because I know that it has different methods that I can use for my app. I need to find a GET/POST type of method that will allow me to get the users input and give them back a result. I also would like to have an animation type of method in my app for the actual Magic 8 Ball. Overall JQuery will relieve my Javascript issues heavily because trying to code this from scratch sounds overwhelming.
