# <center>Week Two Entry</center> 
### <center>This first half of the week I considered between using App Inventor or Flutter to create my app. The second half of the week I brainstormed what the app would be.</center> 
## Monday:
In order to create my app I narrowed down the coding languages to App Inventor and Flutter. I am researching both thoroughly to make sure I am making the right decision. Flutter seems more difficult to persue because it rquires a lot of confusing downloading and setting up. App Inventor seems a little too easy for me and is more block based coding like scratch. I'm leaning more towards Flutter though. I feel like maybe I might be able to do more with it. I also want to challenge myself more. 
## Tuesday:
I have dowloaded the flutter ADK. It is a very large file, therefore it took a while for it to download into C9. I'm looking at the instructions at what to do next and it's very confusing. I've been looking at a few Youtube tutorials on how to set up Flutter and I still don't understant how to start coding. I think it's clear that I'm looking lost because my teacher decided to *casually* sit behind me. I'm starting to have second thoughts about Flutter.

## Wednesday:
Today I'm going to give App Inventor a shot and see what I can do with it. The layout is very similar to Scratch. They have a few projects that I can work on.
