# <center>Week Three Entry</center>
### <center>This week was used for planning what the app will be and setting up phone gap on the computer to begin coding</center>
## Monday:
Today I brainstormed two ideas that I have for the app. Figuring out what I want to create before diving into Javascript will help me learn only what I need. My first idea is to create a magic 8 ball that will help people with decisions. I think this is a cool app idea that I haven't seen on a phone before. My second app idea is to create an app that will help people **binge watch** a new show they've started. It will help users by providing them with a certain amount of episodes they have to watch in a day in order complete the show. I've made two psudocodes for them and already decided which one I am doing.

## Wednesday:
Today I set up phone gap after just downloading it last week. In order to create a new project I needed to have a file locally on the computer. I can't use c9.io anymore therefore I will now be using Atom to code the app. Atom is very similar to c9 so it shouldn't be too difficult to adjust.
