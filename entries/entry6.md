# <center>Week Six Entry</center>
### <center>This week I used positioning and animation in Javascript/JQuery to continue building my app</center>
## Beginning of Week:
Last week I had found the necessary tools to build an MVP of my Magic 8 Ball App. I found a GET/POST method and animation in JQuery that I will use this week. I want to work on the animation aspect of the app first because I want to start deploying this app on an android phone ASAP.

I want the words to appear when the button is clicked. The words fading in with the users answer would be cool to have. I'm going to be using .fadeIn() when the button is clicked and it's going to contain the users answer. I don't know if I'm going to need a GET/POST function anymore because why would I need to take in the users input if the answer is random...
## Middle of Week:
I've implimented the .fadeIn() function and it works very well. I'm able to have the work "YES" fade in when the button is clicked. Now I need to replace "YES" with the random phrase that an 8 Ball typically gives. I know that I'll need to use variables to do this but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
<br><br>
For now I want to work on getting the 8 Ball to shake when the button is clicked. I thought that I could have the ball shake by having it animate left and right. I though this would make the ball move back and forth and create a shake effect but that didn't work. So I found out that there was a shake method (is there anything that JQuery can't do) and I used that in my app instead.

Here's my repl and how I got the ball to shake:

## End of Week:
The **Yes** and the ball were all over the place and I didn't know how to position them the way I wanted to. So I asked my classmates Raquel and Hector for help and they showed me how to use positioning to put divs anywhere I need them.
Some takeaways this week is to use all your resources carefully. Including online help and help from classmates. I benefited heavily from all this abd will continue to use and ask for help in the following weeks. Next week I hope to have an MVP for sure that I can deploy the app the week after on an android device.
