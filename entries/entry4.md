# <center>Week Four Entry</center>
### <center>This week I began to create my app and used Code Camp to figure out a MVC method in Javascript.</center>
## Monday:
Today I will begin to code my Magic 8 Ball app. I know that in order to do this I must take in the users input and have the Magic 8 Ball return a random phrase. First I must learn how to get the users input and send the user to another page that reveals their answer. I have done this before when using Ruby and Sinatra. There was an index.erb and result.erb that were able to work with eachother. I'm hoping that I can do something similar like this in javascript to use in my app.
## Tuesday: 
I was looking around code camp today and found an interesting [article](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-map-method-to-extract-data-from-an-array/) that will help me in the future. The article teaches me how to extract data from an array. This will be useful later on because the different phrases that the 8 Ball has will be in an array. Now I will know how to extract the data to give to the user. I still need to figure out how I will display it to the user though.
