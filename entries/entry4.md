# <center>Week Four Entry</center>
### <center>This week I began to create my app and used Code Camp to figure out a MVC method in Javascript.</center>
## Monday:
Today I will begin to code my Magic 8 Ball app. I know that in order to do this I must take in the users input and have the Magic 8 Ball return a random phrase. First I must learn how to get the users input and send the user to another page that reveals their answer. I have done this before when using Ruby and Sinatra. There was an index.erb and result.erb that were able to work with eachother. I'm hoping that I can do something similar like this in javascript to use in my app.
## Tuesday: 
I was looking around code camp today and found an interesting [article](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-map-method-to-extract-data-from-an-array/) that will help me in the future. The article teaches me how to extract data from an array. This will be useful later on because the different phrases that the 8 Ball has will be in an array. Now I will know how to extract the data to give to the user. I still need to figure out how I will display it to the user though.

## Wednesday: 
Today I will run what I have so far on Phone Gap to make sure it will work when it is on a device. I mostly have some css but it will be enough.
It does run on phone gap but I wish it were more functional. I want to create a POST/GET Method like I was able to do on Ruby/Sinatra but I'm afraid it'll be more complex than I think. Tomorrow I will research this more and try and figure out a way.
## Thursday:
I don't see anything on code camp that can help me. I will do a google search and see what comes up. On google I see that I don't need any javascript because it can all be done with HTML... This is interesting. I think it's going to be a little more complex than that though. Another site I saw said that I needed to use JQuery in order to have an MVC type of structure for my app. I'm going to attempt to do it with HTML but I'm going to be a little bummed if it is that simple because I haven't really used any javascript so far.
## Friday:
I set up the local file on the computer to github so that I can work on the project during the break.
## Takeaways/Summary:
A takeaway I have is that I'm feeling like I'm running low on time but that is okay because I work best under pressure and I'm going to take the whole nine weeks to complete this project. When I get bacl I hope to fully tackle this project and start making it functional enough on Phone Gap so that I can bring in an andriod device and see if it'll run there as well.
